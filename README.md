# To do App
A Web Application for securely managing a To Do List.
I added the functionality of updating the display of the completed tasks, the settings of the number of page to display, and the sort keyword, and i added the data to the local storage. and I added a log in feature and an authentication system that allows user to do tasks based on their roles. I used reducers and context API to manage the project state

-Note: for the backend side i used my API that i have built previously [https://auth-api-ylcl.onrender.com](https://auth-api-ylcl.onrender.com)

### Setup:
run: `npm i`

#### users:
here are some users you can try to log in with:

- an Admin user that has all the capabilities:

    - password: s123
