# To do App
A Web Application for securely managing a To Do List.
The users can register then log in to the system, The users can add to their to-do list and toggle the completeness of each one after that, the users then can change the settings by update the display of the completed tasks, the settings of the number of page to display, and the sort keyword. Users can do tasks based on their roles. I used reducers and context API to manage the project state and local storage to save to the to-do list.

-Note: for the backend side i used my API that i have built previously [https://backendserver-h5d1.onrender.com/](https://backendserver-h5d1.onrender.com/)
